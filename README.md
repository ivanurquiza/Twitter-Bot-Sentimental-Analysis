## 📌 Project Description  

This was my **first Natural Language Processing (NLP) project** (in 2022, pre-Chat Era! took me several months of work), built to explore how people express emotions and opinions on Twitter.  

- The bot collected around **5,000 tweets per trending topic**.  
- It performed **sentiment analysis** (polarity & subjectivity) using NLP techniques (NTLK, BERT).  
- Generated **charts and visualizations** of the aggregated sentiment.  
- Automatically **published the insights** through the [@sienteeltweet](https://x.com/sienteeltweet) account.  

The project gained traction, with **retweets from celebrities, companies, and organizations** that amplified the analyses to a broader audience 🚀.

## ⚙️ How It Worked  

1. **Data Collection** – Fetched trending topics and scraped tweets via the Twitter API.  
2. **Sentiment Analysis** – Processed tweets to detect polarity (positive/negative) and subjectivity.  
3. **Visualization** – Built charts summarizing sentiment distribution for each topic.  
4. **Automation** – Generated and posted the plots automatically.

## 📉 Why It Stopped  

In **2023**, Twitter **privatized and restricted its API**, severely limiting free access to tweets.  
- Before: the bot could analyze **thousands of tweets daily**.  
- After: restricted to only a handful → analysis lost statistical meaning.  

Because of this change, the bot became unsustainable and was discontinued.
